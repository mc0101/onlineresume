    Hello, my name is Megan Carroll, and welcome to my website. While my primary interests in coding are SQL and Python,
    I have handcoded this website myself to show my abilities in HTML5 and CSS. I consider this website a work in progress,
    and as I learn other languages, I want to add functionality.<br>
    I have this website organized into a few different sections. My <a href="Skills">Skills</a> section discusses the hard
    and soft skills I've developed throughout my career with links back to the positions where they were developed or 
    used. My <a href="Resume">Resume</a> page has an in-depth account of my accomplishments duties at my previous positions
    dating back to 2007. My <a href="Story">Story</a> page gives a narrative of my professional journey as well as 
    personal interests.<br>
    Thank you for coming to my website! I am always looking to improve my coding skills, so if you have any feedback 
    that you would like to share, please <a href= "mailto:megan.mae.carroll@gmail.com">email me.</a>
