    Hello, my name is Megan Carroll, and welcome to my website. While my primary interests in coding are SQL and Python,
    I have handcoded this website myself to show my abilities in HTML5 and CSS. I consider this website a work in progress,
    and as I learn other languages, I want to add functionality.<br>
    I have this website organized into a few different sections. My <a href="Skills">Skills</a> section discusses the hard
     and soft skills I've developed throughout my career with links back to the positions where they were developed or 
     used. My <a href="Resume">Resume</a> page has an in-depth account of my accomplishments duties at my previous positions
     dating back to 2007. My <a href="Story">Story</a> page
